👉Task1 #Understanding File Permissions in Linux-
🔐 File permissions in Linux control who can read, write, and execute files or directories. Understanding this is crucial for managing security and access on Linux systems.
1.	Types of Permissions:
o	Read (r): View file contents.
o	Write (w): Modify or delete the file.
o	Execute (x): Run the file as a program.
2.	Permission Structure: Each file has permissions for three categories:
o	Owner (u)
o	Group (g)
o	Others (o)
3.	Common Commands:
•	ls -l: View permissions of files in a directory.
•	chown: Change file ownership permissions.
•	chmod: Change file user permissions.
•	chgrp: Change  file group permissions.
👉Task2 #Access Control Lists (ACL):
🔐 Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Linux: Enhancing File Permissions.
ACLs allow you to define fine-grained permissions beyond the basic owner, group, and others model. With ACLs, you can specify permissions for individual users or groups on a per-file or per-directory basis.
Key Commands
Viewing ACLs: getfacl filename
Setting ACLs: setfacl -m u:username:rwx filename
Removing ACLs: setfacl -x u:username filename
Default ACLs (for directories): setfacl -d -m u:username:rwx directory_name
👉Task3 #Understanding Sticky Bit, SUID, and SGID
🔐 Linux offers powerful mechanisms for controlling access to files and directories beyond basic read, write, and execute permissions. Three key special permissions are Sticky Bit, Setuid (SUID), and Setgid (SGID).
•	Sticky Bit: Controls deletion rights in shared directories.
•	SUID: Elevates the privileges of an executable file to the file owner's.
•	SGID: Ensures files in a directory inherit the group ownership.

👉Task4 #Backup and Restore Permissions:

🔐 Managing file and directory permissions is essential for system security and smooth operations. Sometimes, you need to back up and restore permissions — whether it’s for migration, troubleshooting, or recovery after an accidental change.
Key Commands
#Backing Up Permissions- #getfacl -R /path/to/directory > permissions_backup.acl
# Restoring Permissions- # setfacl --restore=permissions_backup.acl
