#Day 13 Task: Advance Git & GitHub for DevOps Engineers

Today, I dove deep into some of the most powerful concepts in Git, essential for any DevOps engineer: branching, revert/reset, and rebase vs. merge!

🔹 Git Branching: Created new branches to isolate development, added features, and merged them into the main branch. Branching helps us work on new features and bug fixes without disturbing the main project.

🔹 Git Revert & Reset: Learned how to restore files to a previous version with Git revert and reset. These commands are lifesavers when dealing with “gadbad” code!

🔹 Git Rebase & Merge: Practiced rebasing and merging – both useful in different situations but with different impacts on commit history. Rebasing keeps the history clean, while merging preserves the commit log.

✅ Completed a feature development task with multiple commits, demonstrated working with branches, and even practiced some rebasing. The more I explore Git, the more I appreciate its ability to handle complex version control scenarios.

📈 These skills are a must for maintaining a clean, efficient workflow in any DevOps pipeline!
